## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I want the second player to be an bot that the user plays against. I can implement this feature by writing some logic for player 0 to scan the board for all potential winning solutions before selecting a square.

Another feature that I want to implement is a "play again" button that will reset the state of the board and let the user play another game. I can implement this feature by passing a reset flag to all the cells. If the reset flag is true, then the state of the square will be reset to its original state.
